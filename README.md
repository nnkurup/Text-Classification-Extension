# Text-Classification-Extension
This is an extension with basic features and can classify only certain specific sentences as hate propaganda, terrorism, positive, and neutral. This is a basic extension for classifying text and sentences on the four specified grounds. Due to the high rise of political ideologies and hate propaganda spreading throughout the internet and the world, we came up with this idea to take countermeasures to deal with this situation. This contains all those parts including the development part using HTML, CSS, and JS for the front-end part and the use of python - flask for the backend along with a basic level training of NLPs to identify words or any hate content which is being mentioned or shared. There is a lot more enhancements that have to be done, especially in the part where we need to train the NLPs to identify a large number of datasets and give accurate classification.
